        <div class="mission-section">
            <h3>What we're trying to do</h3>
            <p>We built this tool because we're tired of all the fake news and biased reporting out there. Our app helps you figure out which news articles you can actually trust.</p>
            <p>We don't tell you what to think - we just give you the facts about where the news is coming from and how reliable it seems to be. Then you can decide for yourself what to believe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-highlight">
            <h4>How we show you the full picture</h4>
            <p>One of the coolest things our tool does is show you similar news articles from different sources. This helps you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>See how different news outlets cover the same story</li>
                <li>Compare different perspectives on the same event</li>
                <li>Spot when important facts might be missing from one source</li>
                <li>Understand how different media organizations frame the news</li>
                <li>Get a more complete picture of what's really happening</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This way, you're not just getting one side of the story - you're seeing how multiple reliable sources are reporting on the same event.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer1')">
                <span>What is this "Credibility Index" thing?</span>
                <span id="toggle1">+</span>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer1">
                <p>The Credibility Index is basically a score we give to news articles based on how trustworthy they seem. We look at:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How accurate the facts seem to be</li>
                    <li>Whether the article seems biased or fair</li>
                    <li>How reliable the news source usually is</li>
                    <li>If the article gives you enough background info</li>
                    <li>How current the information is</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We combine all these factors to give each article a score from 0-100. Higher scores mean more trustworthy news.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer('answer2')">
                <span>How does this actually help me?</span>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer2">
                <p>It helps you in a few ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can spot articles that might be biased or missing important facts</li>
                    <li>You can see which news sources are generally more reliable</li>
                    <li>You can compare how different news outlets cover the same story (using our similar articles feature)</li>
                    <li>You can learn to think more critically about what you read</li>
                    <li>You can avoid sharing fake news with your friends and family</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Basically, it gives you a quick way to check if that article you're reading is probably trustworthy or if you should be skeptical.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer3">
                <p>Good question! We work hard to keep our analysis fair:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We train our AI on lots of different news sources, not just one side</li>
                    <li>We're totally open about how we calculate our scores</li>
                    <li>We regularly check our system for any biases</li>
                    <li>We have real journalists review tricky cases</li>
                    <li>We listen to user feedback about our analysis</li>
                    <li>We show you articles from multiple sources so you can compare different viewpoints</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We also show you exactly how we came up with each score, so you can decide for yourself if you think we're being fair.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer4">
                <p>We'd love to see a world where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>News organizations are totally open about who owns them and who funds them</li>
                    <li>Everyone learns how to think critically about what they read online</li>
                    <li>Social media shows you why you're seeing certain posts, not just what they want you to see</li>
                    <li>Good journalism gets the support it deserves</li>
                    <li>You can easily find different viewpoints on any topic (which is why we show similar articles from multiple sources)</li>
                    <li>Technology helps us understand things better, not just manipulate us</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Basically, we want people to have both the freedom to read whatever they want AND the tools to figure out what's actually true.</p>

                <p>You can help in a few simple ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Think critically about what you read online</li>
                    <li>Check sources before sharing news on social media</li>

                    <li>Read news from different places to get different viewpoints (use our similar articles feature to find them!)</li>
                    <li>Tell your friends about our tool so they can check news too</li>
                    <li>Let us know if you think our analysis is wrong about something</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's not about agreeing with everything you read - it's about having the tools to decide what to believe. And seeing multiple perspectives helps with that!</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" id="answer6">
                <p>Our "similar articles" feature is pretty cool - here's how it works:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>When you analyze an article, our system identifies the key topics and facts</li>
                    <li>At the same time it searches for other articles covering the same topic from different reliable sources</li>
                    <li>We show you these articles ranked by how relevant they are and how trustworthy their sources are</li>
                    <li>You can compare how different news outlets are reporting on the same event</li>
                    <li>This helps you see the full picture, not just one side of the story</li>
                </ol>
                <p>It's like getting a second (and third, and fourth) opinion on the news you're reading!</p>
